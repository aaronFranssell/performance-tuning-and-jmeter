Query:

select
c.first_name, c.last_name, o.order_date, p.description
from
customers c inner join
orders o on c.id = o.customer_id inner join
products p on o.product_id = p.id
where
c.id = ''

Run query in dev

Run query in prod, then go back to presentation

EXPLAIN cont cont
Cost is a relative measure of CPU + I/O, NOT time directly
In Postgres, cost is highly configurable, but by default a single unit equates to a single 8 kilobyte read from disk into memory.
The first number is startup cost, which is the estimated cost of reading the first row.
The 2nd number is total cost, which is the estimate of reading all rows.
TL/DR big numbers in costs are bad
A huge jump in startup cost vs total cost is often a sign of where the problem is

Rows are the estimated number of rows returned
Width is the estimated number of bytes returned

Updated table structure

select
c.first_name, c.last_name, o.id, o.customer_id, o.product_id, o.order_date, p.description
from
customers c inner join
orders o on o.CUSTOMER_ID_WITH_INDEX = c.id inner join
products p on o.PRODUCT_ID_WITH_INDEX = p.id
where c.id = ''
